# Project Reflection: Entering the Brazilian Tech Market

## Summary

This project involved analyzing the potential for Eniac to enter the Brazilian tech market. It focused on assessing market demand, evaluating a strategic partnership with Magist,
and determining a viable pricing strategy. The analysis was conducted using data related to Brazilian e-commerce trends, Magist's sales data, and general market insights.

## Languages and Libraries Used

* **Data Analysis:** Data was analyzed from a snapshot of Magist Dataset using MySQL, Tableau, GoogleDocs and Gamma.
* **Presentation:** GoogleDocs was used to create the presentation and Gamma to modify the style and layout.
* **Markdown:** Used for this README file.

## Key Learnings

* **Market Research:** Understanding the importance of thorough market research before entering a new geographical area. This includes analyzing customer demand, delivery logistics,
* and competitive landscapes.
* **Strategic Partnerships:** Recognizing the value of strategic partnerships for market entry, particularly in navigating logistical challenges and leveraging existing market presence.
* **Pricing Strategies:** Learning how to adapt pricing strategies to different markets, considering factors like product condition (refurbished vs. new) and local purchasing power.
* **Data Interpretation:** Practicing the ability to interpret data from various sources (e.g., delivery time statistics, sales percentages) and draw meaningful conclusions.
* **Communication of Insights:** Communicating technical insights to a non-technical audience through a clear and concise presentation format.
* For example, explaining the significance of a 16% sales portion of watches and accessories in Magist's market.

## Challenges Overcame

* **Data Limitations:** The primary challenge was working with limited data provided in the data snapshot. This required making logical inferences and focusing on the available
* information to address the key questions.
* **Market Specifics:** Understanding the nuances of the Brazilian e-commerce market, such as delivery time variations and regional preferences, required careful consideration of
* the provided data.
* **Formulating a Pricing Strategy:** Devising a realistic pricing strategy for refurbished Apple products in Brazil, considering both affordability and profitability, was a challenge
* that was addressed by comparing average payment values.

## Additional Reflections

* The project highlighted the importance of considering logistical factors, such as delivery times, when planning market entry.
* The potential partnership with Magist demonstrates how leveraging existing infrastructure can significantly reduce barriers to entry.
* The pricing strategy emphasizes the need for flexibility and adaptation to local market conditions.
* It would be very beneficial to have access to more detailed sales data, and market research, to provide a more in depth analysis.
